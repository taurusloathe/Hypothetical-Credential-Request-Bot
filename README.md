# Encryption: 
User data is encrypted using AES encryption in the EncryptionLibrary.Encrypt method before being stored in the database. This adds a layer of security by ensuring that even if the data is accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains encrypted and unreadable without the decryption key.
# Secure Storage: 
The encrypted data is stored securely using the SecureStorage.StoreData method.
# Secure Communication: 
Establishes secure communication using TLS/SSL in the EstablishSecureConnection method. This ensures that data transmitted over the network is encrypted, reducing the risk of interception by malicious entities.
# Error Handling and Logging: 
Includes error handling and logging mechanisms using Serilog. Proper error handling helps prevent sensitive information from being exposed through error messages, while logging provides a record of events that can be used for monitoring and auditing purposes.
# Configuration Management: 
Manages configuration settings dynamically and updates them securely. This ensures that sensitive configuration data, such as encryption keys and server addresses, is handled properly and not exposed inadvertently.
# Evasion Techniques: 
Includes polymorphic methods for evading detection (EvadeDetection).
